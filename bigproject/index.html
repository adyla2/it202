                <p1>The GreenHouse Effect :</p1><br>
                <p2>The greenhouse effect is unquestionably real and helps to regulate the temperature of our planet. 
                It is essential for life on Earth and is one of Earth's natural processes. It is the result of heat absorption by certain gases in the atmosphere 
                (called greenhouse gases because they effectively 'trap' heat in the lower 
                atmosphere) and re-radiation downward of some of that heat. Water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas, 
                followed by carbon dioxide and other trace gases. Without a natural greenhouse effect, the temperature of the Earth would be about zero degrees 
                F (-18C) instead of its present 57F (14C). So, the concern is not with the fact that we have a greenhouse effect, but whether human activities are 
                leading to an enhancement of the greenhouse effect by the emission of greenhouse gases through fossil fuel combustion and deforestation.</p2>

                <div class="needsmargin">
                  <p1>Increase of Greenhouse Gases :</p1><br>
                  <p2>Human activity has been increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (mostly carbon dioxide from combustion of coal, 
                  oil, and gas; plus a few other trace gases). There is no scientific debate on this point. Pre-industrial levels of carbon dioxide (prior to the 
                  start of the Industrial Revolution) were about 280 parts per million by volume (ppmv), and current levels are greater than 380 ppmv and increasing 
                  at a rate of 1.9 ppm yr-1 since 2000. The global concentration of CO2 in our atmosphere today far exceeds the natural range over the last 650,000 years 
                  of 180 to 300 ppmv. According to the IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES), by the end of the 21st century,
                  we could expect to see carbon dioxide concentrations of anywhere from 490 to 1260 ppm (75-350% above the pre-industrial concentration).</p2>

                <div>
                  <p1>Global Temperatures :</p1><br>
                  <p2>Global surface temperatures have increased about 0.74C (plus or minus 0.18C) since the late–19th century, and the linear trend for the past 50 years of 0.13C 
                  (plus or minus 0.03C) per decade is nearly twice that for the past 100 years. The warming has not been globally uniform. Some areas (including parts of the 
                  southeastern U.S. and parts of the North Atlantic) have, in fact, cooled slightly over the last century. The recent warmth has been greatest over 
                  North America and Eurasia between 40 and 70N. Lastly, seven of the eight warmest years on record have occurred since 2001 and the 10 warmest years 
                  have all occurred since 1995. Recent analyses of temperature trends in the lower and mid- troposphere (between about 2,500 and 26,000 ft.) using both satellite and 
                  radiosonde (weather balloon) data show warming rates that are similar to those observed for surface air temperatures. These warming rates are consistent with 
                  their uncertainties and these analyses reconcile a discrepancy between warming rates noted on the IPCC Third Assessment Report (U.S. Climate Change Science 
                  Plan Synthesis and Assessment Report 1.1).</p2><br>
                  <p2>An enhanced greenhouse effect is expected to cause cooling in higher parts of the atmosphere because the increased "blanketing" effect in the lower atmosphere 
                  holds in more heat, allowing less to reach the upper atmosphere.Cooling of the lower stratosphere (about 49,000-79,500 ft.) since 1979 is shown by 
                  both satellite Microwave Sounding Unit and radiosonde data (see previous figure), but is larger in the radiosonde data likely due to uncorrected
                  errors in the radiosonde data.Relatively cool surface and tropospheric temperatures, and a relatively warmer lower stratosphere, were observed in 
                  1992 and 1993, following the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. The warming reappeared in 1994. A dramatic global warming, at least partly associated 
                  with the record El Nino, took place in 1998. This warming episode is reflected from the surface to the top of the troposphere.</p2>
                  <p2>There has been a general, but not global, tendency toward reduced diurnal temperature range (DTR: the difference between daily high or maximum and daily 
                  low or minimum temperatures) over about 70% of the global land mass since the middle of the 20th century. However, for the period 1979-2005 the DTR shows no trend 
                  since the trend in both maximum and minimum temperatures for the same period are virtually identical; both showing a strong warming signal. A variety of factors likely 
                  contribute to this change in DTR, particularly on a regional and local basis, including changes in cloud cover, atmospheric water vapor, land use and urban effects.</p2>

                <p1>Rising Sea Level :</p1><br>
                <p2>Global mean sea level has been rising at an average rate of 1.7 mm/year (plus or minus 0.5mm) over the past 100 years, which is significantly larger than the 
                rate averaged over the last several thousand years. Depending on which greenhouse gas increase scenario is used (high or low) projected sea-level rise is projected to 
                be anywhere from 0.18 (low greenhouse gas increase) to 0.59 meters for the highest greenhouse gas increase scenario. However, this increase is due mainly to thermal 
                expansion and contributions from melting alpine glaciers, and does not include any potential contributions from melting ice sheets in Greenland or Antarctica. Larger 
                increases cannot be excluded but our current understanding of ice sheet dynamics renders uncertainties too large to be able to assess the likelihood of large-scale 
                melting of these ice sheets.

                <p1>Future Climate Projections :</p1><br>
                <p2>
                  Due to the enormous complexity of the atmosphere, the most useful tools for gauging future changes are 'climate models'. These are computer-based 
                  mathematical models which simulate, in three dimensions, the climate's behavior, its components and their interactions. Climate models are constantly 
                  improving based on both our understanding and the increase in computer power, though by definition, a computer model is a simplification and simulation
                  of reality, meaning that it is an approximation of the climate system. The first step in any modeled projection of climate change is to first simulate 
                  the present climate and compare it to observations. If the model is considered to do a good job at representing modern climate, then certain parameters
                  can be changed, such as the concentration of greenhouse gases, which helps us understand how the climate would change in response. Projections of 
                  future climate change therefore depend on how well the computer climate model simulates the climate and on our understanding of how forcing functions 
                  will change in the future.The IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios determines the range of future possible greenhouse gas concentrations 
                  (and other forcings) based on considerations such as population growth, economic growth, energy efficiency and a host of other factors. This leads 
                  a wide range of possible forcing scenarios, and consequently a wide range of possible future climates.According to the range of possible forcing 
                  scenarios, and taking into account uncertainty in climate model performance, the IPCC projects a best estimate of global temperature increase of 
                  1.8 - 4.0°C with a possible range of 1.1 - 6.4°C by 2100, depending on which emissions scenario is used. However, this global average will integrate
                  widely varying regional responses, such as the likelihood that land areas will warm much faster than ocean temperatures, particularly those land 
                  areas in northern high latitudes (and mostly in the cold season). Additionally, it is very likely that heat waves and other hot extremes will increase.

                <p1>Climate Variability and Extremes :</p1><br>
                <p2>
                  Examination of changes in climate extremes requires long-term daily or even hourly data sets which until recently have been scarce for many parts 
                  of the globe. However these data sets have become more widely available allowing research into changes in temperature and precipitation extremes 
                  on global and regional scales. Global changes in temperature extremes include decreases in the number of unusually cold days and nights and 
                  increases in the number of unusually warm days and nights. Other observed changes include lengthening of the growing season, and decreases in 
                  the number of frost days. Global temperature extremes have been found to exhibit no significant trend in interannual variability, 
                  but several studies suggest a significant decrease in intra-annual variability. There has been a clear trend to fewer extremely 
                  low minimum temperatures in several widely-separated areas in recent decades. Widespread significant changes in extreme high temperature
                  events have not been observed. There is some indication of a decrease in day-to-day temperature variability in recent decades.

                                        At home, this translates to saving electricity by using energy-efficient appliances and compact fluorescent light bulbs, 
                                        as well as reducing gasoline use and buying green power from your electricity provider, if available.</p>

                                        <p>Because carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas, planting trees and other plants can slow or stop global warming.
                                        Deforestation of rain forests is a large contributor to global warming and CO2 emissions, but planting new trees, even in your own backyard, 
                                        can help to offset this.</p>

                                        <p>Decomposing waste in landfills produces methane and other greenhouse gases. Waste also requires energy to manufacture in the first place. 
                                        Reducing your consumption patterns and reusing items whenever possible minimizes your carbon footprint, since fewer new items need to be made. 
                                        Recycling metal, plastic, glass and paper lowers greenhouse gas emissions, since recycled items take far less energy to manufacture than items produced from scratch.</p>

                                        <p>Cities consume significant amounts of energy when purifying and distributing water, which contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. 
                                        Saving water reduces the amount of energy used. At home, turn off water immediately whenever you're not using it, and repair or replace leaky faucets and toilets. 
                                        In your yard, landscape with plants and grasses that require less water, and capture rainwater in barrels for irrigating.</p>
