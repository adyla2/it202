1.What was the overall experience of the app?

It was nice, simple, and seemingly worked well. The marker palcement lagged a bit. 

2. Was it easy to get familiar with the app?

Yes. 

3. How easy was it to solve tasks with minimal effort? 

Other than the waiting on markers, everything was straight forward. 

4. Is it exciting and motivating to use the app?

It was alright. Not personally the topic I would be interested in. 

5. Any feedback:

More visual would be nice, seeing more drastic changes with more years worth of data. Fix lag problems with marker placement, 
there were times I thought it wasnt working because of the wait time.
